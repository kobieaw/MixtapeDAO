1) Use AI to analyze videographers recording style and editing style to be able to recreate the video 
2) Allow a regular person to record people playing sports (these people have given consent and want a mixtape made). 
3) The video file gets edited to the end user's (person being recorded) liking by the AI, they then get a mixtape 
4) Person recording gets paid for doing the recording work 
5) Original videographer gets paid for the AI using their style/template 
6) End user pays to get the mixtape made
